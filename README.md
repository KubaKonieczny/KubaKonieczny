# Hi there, I'm Kuba ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student of Computer Science and Inteligent Systems at AGH University of Science and Technology in Cracow, Poland. I'm interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science. 
<!---This GitHub profile is a place where I share my projects and learning experiences related to these topics. 

## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have worked on:
<!---
- [Project 1](link): A project where I implemented a machine learning algorithm to predict the stock prices of a company. 
- [Project 2](link): An analysis of a dataset on customer churn in a telecommunications company using data science techniques.
- [Project 3](link): A deep learning project where I trained a neural network to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. --->

## Learning

I'm constantly learning new things in the field of ML, AI, and data science. Here are some of the resources I have found useful:

- [Resource 1](link): A book that provides an introduction to machine learning.
- [Resource 2](link): An online course on deep learning.
- [Resource 3](link): A blog post on data visualization techniques.
Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or if you'd like to collaborate on a project related to ML, AI, or data science. You can contact me via
